Get firsthand experience of creating a small inhabited universe 
and observe the many patterns in which this “life” can evolve. 
Generation by generation, watch the cells come and go, reacting to their environment, 
perishing from loneliness or finding comfort in company.

The universe in this game looks like a grid in which each cell has one of two possible states: populated (alive) or not populated (dead).
 - Evolution is controlled by two rules:
A live cell survives if it has two or three live neighbors; otherwise, it dies of boredom (<2) or overpopulation (>3).
A dead cell is reborn if it has exactly three live neighbors.

The program should apply these rules to each cell in order to compute the next generation.

One buttons toggle pause/resume, another start evolution over again, with a different initial state.
The third button sets the size of the universe.
